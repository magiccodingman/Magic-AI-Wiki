# Magic-AI-Wiki

The following is a wiki on building a 48 GB VRAM AI server for at home home lab enthusiasts. This was created based on my personal experience building such a server and what I learned. I made alterations based on community feedback as well. But the pricing and build was created in late 2023, in which the prices are no longer the same. But it's still achievable and I believe this wiki still serves great use, is very informative, but in my opinion.
